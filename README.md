Meet [Youtrack](https://dub.sh/youtrack-website-readme), an open-source project management tool to track issues, run ~sprints~ cycles, and manage product roadmaps without the chaos of managing the tool itself. 🧘‍♀️

> Youtrack is evolving every day. Your suggestions, ideas, and reported bugs help us immensely. Do not hesitate to join in the conversation on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/A92xrEGCge) or raise a GitHub issue. We read everything and respond to most.

## ⚡ Installation

The easiest way to get started with Youtrack is by creating a [Youtrack Cloud](https://app.youtrack.so) account.

If you would like to self-host Youtrack, please see our [deployment guide](https://docs.youtrack.so/docker-compose).

`Instance admins` can configure instance settings with [God-mode](https://docs.youtrack.so/instance-admin).

## 🚀 Features

- **Issues**: Quickly create issues and add details using a powerful rich text editor that supports file uploads. Add sub-properties and references to problems for better organization and tracking.

- **Cycles**:
  Keep up your team's momentum with Cycles. Gain insights into your project's progress with burn-down charts and other valuable features.

- **Modules**: Break down your large projects into smaller, more manageable modules. Assign modules between teams to track and plan your project's progress easily.

- **Views**: Create custom filters to display only the issues that matter to you. Save and share your filters in just a few clicks.

- **Pages**: Youtrack pages, equipped with AI and a rich text editor, let you jot down your thoughts on the fly. Format your text, upload images, hyperlink, or sync your existing ideas into an actionable item or issue.

- **Analytics**: Get insights into all your Youtrack data in real-time. Visualize issue data to spot trends, remove blockers, and progress your work.

- **Drive** (_coming soon_): The drive helps you share documents, images, videos, or any other files that make sense to you or your team and align on the problem/solution.
